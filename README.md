# blu-ray-wish-list-v-000

This website provides a simple wishlist for Blu-Rays the user wants to purchase.
An added feature is a catalog of movies the user has already purchased. A visitor
this website will be able to see their movies categorized by Genre Tags as well as
other user's publicly listed discs as assisting tools to spark ideas for new discs
to add.
